# Crossbar parameters
crossbar:
  size:  # Size of M x N crossbar array
    m: 256  # Number of columns (output_dim maps here)
    n: 256  # Number of rows (input_dim maps here)
  resolution_weight_bits: 4  # Bits of precision per crossbar cell
  resolution_input_bits: 1  # Bits of precision per input
  mvm_write_latency: 56  # Latency for writing to crossbar (in us)
  mvm_execute_latency: 1.4  # Latency for executing MVM operation (in us)
# Mapper parameters
mapper:
  # Weight mapping mode for crossbar cells (with aliases)
  # Options:
  #   - offset (of): Weights biased positive, +1 units column
